## Introduction

[SpiceDB is a database focused on authorization and access control](https://authzed.com/docs/spicedb/getting-started/discovering-spicedb), designed to implement fine-grained authorization (FGA) at scale. In this article, "SpiceDB in Action," you will learn how to use SpiceDB by building a simple full-stack application that takes advantage of its robust access control capabilities.

Specifically, the journey begins with spinning up SpiceDB locally. You will then create a basic schema and develop a small full-stack app that demonstrates how to effectively use SpiceDB's access control features. As you progress, you'll gain insights into key SpiceDB concepts, and by the end of this article, you will have a solid understanding of how to incorporate SpiceDB into your projects.
