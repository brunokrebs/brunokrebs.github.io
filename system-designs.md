# System Design Series - Master Prompt

## Project Overview

I'm Bruno Krebs, a software development consultant with 20 years of experience helping US startups build scalable systems. I'm creating a comprehensive blog series about system design to:

1. **Deepen my own understanding** of system design patterns, architectures, and trade-offs
2. **Create valuable content** for my personal blog that demonstrates expertise to potential clients
3. **Build a reference library** of system design knowledge that I can use in consulting work

## Target Audience

- **Primary**: Engineering leaders and senior developers at US startups (my potential clients)
- **Secondary**: Mid-level engineers looking to advance their system design skills
- **Tone**: Professional but approachable, focusing on practical insights over academic theory

## Content Strategy

Each article should:
- **Start with a real problem** that startups commonly face
- **Explain the underlying concepts** clearly without being condescending
- **Show practical examples** and implementation details
- **Discuss trade-offs** honestly - no silver bullets
- **Connect to business impact** - why does this matter for a growing company?

## Writing Style Guidelines

- **Industry patterns focus**: discuss common challenges and solutions across the industry rather than positioning everything as personal experience
- **Humble expertise**: share knowledge without being arrogant or pushy
- **Concrete examples**: real companies when possible (but in no situation you are allowed to create fictional situations or companies), specific numbers, architectural diagrams and decision frameworks rather than implementation code
- **Avoid buzzwords**: explain concepts clearly rather than throwing around jargon (also, no acronyms without first spelling them out)
- **Structure for skimming**: headers, bullet points, clear sections

## Current Foundation

I've already published "The Complete Guide to System Design Categories" which covers:
1. Social Media & Communication Systems
2. Content Distribution & Media Systems
3. E-commerce & Marketplace Systems
4. Search & Discovery Systems
5. Location-based & On-demand Services
6. Data Processing & Analytics Systems
7. Infrastructure & Platform Systems
8. Collaborative & Productivity Systems

## Series Structure Ideas

**Deep Dives** - Pick specific systems (like "Designing a Real-time Chat System") and walk through the entire architecture

**Pattern Exploration** - Focus on cross-cutting patterns that apply across multiple system categories (like "Real-time System Scaling" or "Data Consistency Patterns")

**Trade-off Analysis** - Compare different approaches (like "SQL vs NoSQL: When to Choose What")

**Scaling Stories** - Chronicle how systems evolve from 1K to 1M to 100M users

**Tool Comparisons** - Practical guides comparing technologies with decision frameworks

## Learning Goals

Through writing this series, I want to:
- Solidify my understanding of distributed systems patterns
- Learn about modern tools and technologies I haven't used extensively
- Develop better frameworks for making architectural decisions
- Create content that showcases depth of knowledge to consulting prospects

## Instructions for Claude Code

When I start a new article in this series:

1. **Read this context** to understand the overall goals and style
2. **Suggest specific topics** that would fit well in the series and help achieve my learning goals
3. **Help structure each article** with clear sections and practical examples
4. **Review drafts** to ensure they match the professional-but-approachable tone
5. **Suggest follow-up topics** that would naturally build on each article

The goal is to create a comprehensive, practical system design resource while deepening my own expertise and demonstrating knowledge to potential consulting clients.

## File Structure

Articles will be stored in `source/_posts/` with markdown format and proper frontmatter including:
- Title, excerpt, date, author
- Tags for system design concepts covered
- Series metadata to link related articles

Let's build something valuable together!
